# wireframing
Wireframing is the process of creating a simplified visual guide or blueprint of a website, mobile app, or software interface. It serves as a foundational design tool that outlines the structure, layout, and functionality of a digital product before any detailed design or coding begins.
# important of wireframing
Wireframes play a critical role in the design and development process for several reasons:

1. Visualizing Layout & Structure
Wireframes help stakeholders visualize how content and features will be organized on a screen, providing a clear picture of page layouts without the distraction of colors, fonts, or detailed graphics.

2. Clarifying User Flow & Navigation
By mapping out user journeys, wireframes ensure smooth navigation, helping designers identify potential usability issues early.

3. Facilitating Collaboration
Wireframes provide a visual reference for discussions between designers, developers, product managers, and clients, making sure everyone is aligned on the projectâ€™s direction.

4. Saving Time & Resources
Identifying design flaws or feature gaps during the wireframing stage prevents costly revisions later in the development cycle.
